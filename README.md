## Installation 

1. Download the latest BepInEx IL2CPP x86 .zip from https://builds.bepis.io/projects/bepinex_be.
2. Right click Among Us in Steam.  Go to manage, then browse local files.
3. Extract the .zip into this folder so the folder structure has `\Among Us\BepInEx\`.
4. Run the game through steam and exit when it's fully loaded, this will create directories / files needed for the mod. (This might take a while.)
5. Download the latest release at https://github.com/Tran-Foxxo/PlayablePets/releases.
6. Put the downloaded .dll into `\Among Us\BepInEx\plugins\`.
7. Run the game and use a pet that you own and you'll become the pet!
8. (Optional) Change the configs in `\Among Us\BepInEx\config\trankampling.playablepets.cfg` to your liking.

## To-dos 

- [ ] Keep the mod up to date. 
- [ ] Make a itch.io version if the steam version isn't compatible. 
- [ ] Move name up a bit more for the taller pets.
- [ ] Maybe a custom sprite for dead pets? (Instead of a crewmate body)
